# SQL Interview Questions  - Quiz


## Introduction

This quiz contains questions on topics you can expect to see in an interview pertaining to SQL and Relational Databases. Some of them are multiple choice, while some are short answer. For these short answer questions, double click on the Jupyter Notebook and type your answer below the line. 

## Question 1

What are the 4 main datatypes in SQLite3? Can we use other common types from other kinds of SQL?

Type your answer below this line:
_________ In SQLite, data types are quite flexible compared to traditional relational databases. SQLite uses a dynamic typing system, which means that the type of a value is determined by the actual value stored rather than the declared column type. Including : Null, Integer, Real, Text, Blob______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________





## Question 2

Explain the relationship between **Primary Keys** and **Foreign Keys**.

Type your answer below this line:
_____________The relationship between Primary Keys and Foreign Keys is central to the concept of data integrity and relational database design. These two types of keys help establish connections between different tables in a relational database.

## Question 3

Explain the different types of relationships entities can have in a SQL database. 

Type your answer below this line:
__________In a SQL database, entities (tables) can have various types of relationships with each other. These relationships define how the data in one table is associated with the data in another table. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


## Question 4

Explain the various types of JOINs possible with SQL. 

Type your answer below this line:
__________________________In many-to-many relationships, associative entities (often called join tables) serve a crucial role by acting as an intermediary between two tables. They are used to represent the relationships between records in those two tables, allowing for the connection of multiple records in one table to multiple records in another._____________________________________________________________________________________________________



## Question 5

Explain the relationship between Aggregate functions and GROUP BY statements.

Type your answer below this line:
_____________________________________The GROUP BY statement is used to group rows based on one or more columns, and aggregate functions are then applied to each group to calculate summary statistics like counts, sums, averages, etc. They work together to provide summarized data for each group in the result set.__________________________________________________________________________________________



## Question 6

What role do Associative Entities play (JOIN Tables) in many-to-many JOINs?
In many-to-many relationships, associative entities (join tables) are used to represent and maintain the connection between records in two different tables. They allow each record from one table to be associated with multiple records from another table, and vice versa, by storing the foreign keys of both tables. This approach is crucial for breaking down complex relationships in relational databases while maintaining data integrity and reducing redundancy.
